# NBA Player Data Analysis

# Motivation
I downloaded the ASA All NBA data set, that consists of all the players in depth statistics. I will be looking at for example the 3 point percentage of players and if that has any correlation with how much they get paid, compared to others who don't shoot as well. There may be some fascinating results that may or may not shock you. I've always have had a passion for sports analytics. This was a great opportuninty to explore this avenue of diving deep into the data and seeing what I could find and compare. 
# Data Source
I obtained the data from https://advancedsportsanalytics.com whom provides quantitative DFS strategy and tools for fantasy football, basketball, baseball, and golf contests. The aspect of it being used for fantasy sport contests allowed for me to gather more in depth data than other data sources. I also used https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries for collecting the salary data for the players. 
# Processing Steps
Luckily the data was already processed and cleaned nicely. It was easy to use and find what I wanted to showcase on python. 
# Visualization
Once I had processed the data, https://github.com/ethanadamian/Data115Project/issues/1#issue-755656266
