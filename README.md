# Average NBA Team Salaries and Players
This project is about seeing the trend in the salaries of players and average team salaries and how over the years it has increased. 
What motivated me to do this project is how players in the NBA these days are significantly paid higher than players in the 80s for an example. 
All the script was written in Python a free and easy to install computer language.
